# The IT company "Soft ComInfo" has decided to transfer its messages through
# the N/W using
# new encryption technique.
# The company has decided to encrypt the data using the non-prime number
# concept.
# The message is in the form of a number and the sum of non-prime digits
# present in the message is used as the encryption key.
# Write an algorithm to determine the encryption key.
# input ------> The input consists of an integer numMsg representing the numeric
# form of the message.
# output ------> print an integer representing the encryption key.
# note: Digit 1 and 0 are considered as tha prime number.
